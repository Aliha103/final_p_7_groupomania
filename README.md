This project is designed to run on a Node.js server and is accessible through localhost:3000.

This is the front end and back end server for Project 7 of the Web Developer path.

Back end Prerequisites
You will need to have Node and npm installed locally on your machine.

Back end Installation
Clone this repo. From the "back" folder of the project, run npm install. You can then run the server with node server. The server should run on localhost with default port 3000. If the server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the console when the server starts, e.g. Listening on port 8000.
